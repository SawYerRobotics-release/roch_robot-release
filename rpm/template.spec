%description
A controller ensuring the safe operation of roch. The SafetyController keeps
track of ult, psd and cliff events. In case of the first three, roch is
commanded to move back. This controller can be enabled/disabled. The safety
states (cliff, psd and ult etc.) can be reset. WARNING: Dangerous! Refrence with
yujinrobot' kobuki.
